## Data Structure

### Reschedule History Format
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "by": "staff_username",
  "previousDate": "2024-01-20",
  "previousTime": "14:00",
  "action": "rescheduled|restored|archived"
}
```

### Analytics Response Structure
```json
{
  "totalReschedules": 150,
  "reschedulesByStaff": {
    "staff1": 45,
    "staff2": 32
  },
  "reschedulesByMonth": {
    "2024-01": 25,
    "2024-02": 30
  },
  "frequentReschedules": [...],
  "highRiskAppointments": [...],
  "averageReschedulesPerAppointment": 1.2
}
```

## Risk Levels and Alerts

### Risk Classification
- **Low Risk**: 1 reschedule
- **Medium Risk**: 2 reschedules
- **High Risk**: 3+ reschedules

### Alert System
- **Dashboard Alert**: Shows when high-risk appointments are detected
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded risk levels in tables
- **Export Functionality**: CSV export for detailed analysis

## Business Rules and Recommendations

### Hospital Brand Protection
1. **Monitor High-Risk Appointments**: Appointments with 3+ reschedules require immediate attention
2. **Staff Accountability**: Track which staff members are making frequent changes
3. **Trend Analysis**: Monitor monthly patterns to identify systemic issues

### Recommended Actions
1. **Immediate**: Review all high-risk appointments (3+ reschedules)
2. **Weekly**: Analyze staff rescheduling patterns
3. **Monthly**: Review overall rescheduling trends
4. **Quarterly**: Assess appointment team performance

### Quality Metrics
- **Target**: < 1.0 average reschedules per appointment
- **Warning**: > 2.0 average reschedules per appointment
- **Critical**: > 3.0 average reschedules per appointment

## Usage Instructions

### Accessing Analytics

2. **Full Report**: Available from analytics page
3. **Format**: CSV files with comprehensive data

### Monitoring Dashboard
- **Green Indicators**: Good performance (low reschedule rates)
- **Yellow Indicators**: Warning (moderate reschedule rates)
- **Red Indicators**: Critical (high reschedule rates)

## Technical Implementation

### Sheet Integration
- **appointment sheet**: Active appointments with reschedule history
- **cancel sheet**: Cancelled appointments with reschedule history
